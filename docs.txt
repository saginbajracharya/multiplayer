4 Elements of Game Mechanics

1 quantity
    [Mechanics that can be represented as a number] 
    Examples:
    [Resource: Health, Mana ,Energy,Rage]
    [Currency: Gold,gems]
    [Abstract: Time]
2 spatial
    [Mechanics that affect space]
    Examples:
    [World : Position and rotation of objects]
    [Tangible : Collision,characters,props]
    [Intangible : Inventory,storage]
3 state 
    [Mechanics that apply additional rules]
    Examples:
    [Player : Ground, airborne, swimming, alive, dead]
    [Game : Victory, lobby, loading]
    [Objects : On, off, open, closed]
4 action
    [Mechanics that drive change]
    Examples:
    [Resource : Health regen, shooting ammo]
    [World : Running, jumping, teleporting]
    [Object : Unlock door, open chest]


Example (Mario)

Big or small are state mechanics that 
(1) apply to Mario, 
(2) visually represent Mario’s health points (quantity), and 
(3) affect how tall Mario is when he is standing (spatial). 
    When Mario collides with another entity (spatial), 
    that entity may change Mario’s health state to big, to small, or to dead (action).


Using Bernstein’s layers as a guide, generative game design takes the perspective that all games can be understood within the following 4 layers:

1. Game (Surface Structure) — the sensory form in which the game is experienced
2. Prose (Deep Structure) — the underlying structure that configures player behavior
3. Mechanics (Underlying strings) — the smallest units that have meaning
4. Attributes (Chosen elements) — a discrete unit that distinguishes one interaction from another
